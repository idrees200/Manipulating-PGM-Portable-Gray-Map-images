# Manipulating-PGM-Portable-Gray-Map-images
This code defines a PGMImage class that provides functionalities for loading, saving, and manipulating PGM (Portable Gray Map) images. The class includes various methods to perform operations such as creating a negative image, applying mean and median filters, rotating the image by arbitrary angles or in 90-degree increments, flipping the image horizontally and vertically, resizing, and cropping the image.

Features:
LoadImage: Loads a PGM image from a file.
SaveImage: Saves the current image to a file.
Create_Negative: Creates a negative of the current image.
Mean_Filter: Applies a mean filter to the image.
Median_Filter: Applies a median filter to the image.
Rotate: Rotates the image by an arbitrary angle.
RotateClockwise: Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.
RotateCounterClockwise: Rotates the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
FlipHorizontal: Flips the image horizontally.
FlipVertical: Flips the image vertically.
Resize: Resizes the image to new dimensions.
CropImage: Crops the image to specified dimensions.
Savefliphorizontal: Saves the horizontally flipped image.
Saveflipvertical: Saves the vertically flipped image.
Savecounterclock: Saves the counter-clockwise rotated image.
